# Python Script for Modelling and Identification 
## General info
MiI is a Class at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology focused on programming and statistic

## Number Generation
Script contains OO Classes that can generate numbers from desired distributions:
* uniform distribution using time based seed and complex equations
* using Quantile function, precalculated or given by user
* using Rejection sampling, with finite and infinite range
* using Discrete Quantile function, numerically calculated from distribution function
* using Quantile function, calculted by hand, for discrete distibution

## Analisis
Script contains function for testing lists filled with numbers:
* histogram calculator
* pairing test, for causality check
* autocorrelation calculator
* chi-square test
*
## Estimators
Script contains OOP based, easy to use:
* mean estimator
* variance estimator, biased
* variance estimator, unbiased
* cumulative distribution function estimator
* kernel based distribution function estimator
* various error or variance of estimator calculators
